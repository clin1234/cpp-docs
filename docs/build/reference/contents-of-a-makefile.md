# Contents of a Makefile

A makefile contains:

- [Description blocks](description-blocks.md)

- [Commands](commands-in-a-makefile.md)

- [Macros](macros-and-nmake.md)

- [Inference rules](inference-rules.md)

- [Dot directives](dot-directives.md)

- [Preprocessing directives](makefile-preprocessing.md)

## Remarks

Other features you can use in a makefile are [wildcards](wildcards-and-nmake.md), [long filenames](long-filenames-in-a-makefile.md), [comments](comments-in-a-makefile.md), and [special characters](special-characters-in-a-makefile.md).
